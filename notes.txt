GAME STRUCTURE
 Definitions: 
    - Defining the variables needed
    - Creating the game objects
 Game Loop:
    - Updating the postions of the game objects
    - Checking for collisions



Game Loop
1. Event Handling
2. Updating Positions
3. Drawing Objects


Display Surface - it is like blank canvas, we can only have on per game 
Regular Surface - essentially a single image (something imported, rendered text or a plain color)
Rect - rectangles are used for positioning, collision detection and for drawing objects

after putting in all the graphic corrdinates,
created an off-set to be able to move the blocks, then re-position all the blocks to the middle of
the grid where it would spawn

Game Class - it will be a container for all the elements for our game 
   - update block position
   - checking for block collision
   - code will be easier to read and de-bug
